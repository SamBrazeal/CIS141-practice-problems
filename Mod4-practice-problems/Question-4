#4. A theater wants to enforce age restrictions for movie tickets. Ask the user for their age,
#and tell them whether they can see G (appropriate for under 13), PG-13 (appropriate for 13 to 17),
#or R (appropriate for over 18) rated movies.

Age = int(input("What is your age: "))

if Age < 13:
    print("You can see G movies")
elif Age <= 17:
    print("You can watch PG-13 movies")
else:
    print("You can watch R movies")
